Banks have full control of this ledger and can modify it as they see fit. However, they are incentivized to ensure the accuracy of the ledger because their reputation is staked on it.
On a blockchain, the transaction ledger is decentralized and requires a consensus mechanism to ensure the transactions are accurately recorded. Three of the main consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Proof of Authority.</description></item></channel></rss>
