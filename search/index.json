[{"content":"Bitcoin’s blockchain is a database that records the flow of its native currency, bitcoin. Bitcoin’s blockchain is a distributed, cryptographic, and immutable database that uses proof-of-work to keep the ecosystem intact. Let’s do a brief overview of these terms to dive into the inner workings of Bitcoin’s blockchain.\nDistributed refers to the way in which computers access Bitcoin’s blockchain. The great thing about Bitcoin’s blockchain is that it is decentralized, meaning any computer in the world can access it. Every transaction made on the blockchain is transparent, so everyone is on a level playing field.\nCryptographic in relation to Bitcoin is what allows the computers building Bitcoin’s blockchain to collaborate in an automated system of mathematical trust. When a transaction occurs on the chain, there is no subjectivity; it is confirmed by complex math equations that take supercomputers to solve.\nImmutable means that information on Bitcoin’s blockchain is permanent and cannot be erased. In most digital environments, things can be erased. Take your search history for example. Bitcoin leverages this feature of immutability as it creates a system of trust in a world of potentially untrustworthy people.\nProof-of-Work is what ties these other terms together and gets a little more complicated. Proof-of-work, or PoW, deals with how transactions are grouped in blocks, and how those blocks are chained together to make Bitcoin’s blockchain. The computers that build Bitcoin’s blockchain use PoW to get the privilege to add blocks of transactions to Bitcoin’s blockchain. Each time a computer adds a block to the chain, they receive bitcoin currency for doing so, which provides the incentive. This process of “mining” bitcoin is what grows the blockchain.\n","date":"2021-04-17T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://blog.songcha.in/p/a-simplified-view-of-bitcoin-and-blockchains-inner-workings/","title":"A simplified view of Bitcoin and Blockchain’s inner workings"},{"content":"Cryptography is the science of secure information. It involves taking information and scrambling it in such a way that only the intended recipient can understand and use it.\nLet’s think of cryptography in three categories: encryption on one side, decryption on the other, and cryptography stuck in the middle. Cryptography is the battlefield on which those trying to transmit information securely combat those attempting to decrypt and manipulate the information. Cryptography is not a new subject; humans have used cryptography for thousands of years. For example, Julius Caesar used cryptography to inform his generals of his plans in times of war. He would send messages using letters that were three letters after the letter they were supposed to represent. For instance, the letters ABC would be written as DEF. This is a very basic form of encryption but was beneficial to Caesar during his reign.\nCryptography is a vital part of our lives today. Every time we type in a password or pay with a credit card, we utilize cryptography. Without cryptography, it would be easy for hackers to steal sensitive information and use it for personal gain. Cryptography ensures that our information can only be used for who it is intended.\n","date":"2021-04-17T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://blog.songcha.in/p/what-is-cryptography/","title":"What is Cryptography?"},{"content":"Every asset market has recognizable, household names attached to them. In terms of the equities markets, you may think of Warren Buffet, Benjamin Graham, or even Elon Musk. You think of these people for their popularity, and also their notoriety within the game that is the stock market. The market for NFTs is still in its infancy, but we are already seeing major players emerge as marker creators and market movers. In this piece, I will outline some key names that you should look out for when utilizing the NFT market.\nThe first big name is Mike Winkelmann, better known as Beeple. Beeple is on the artist/creator side of the market and has made a name for himself through the creation of unique digital masterpieces. His piece titled “Everydays: The First 5000 Days,” was largely responsible for the mainstream media’s coverage on NFT sales. Seeing as this token sold for $69,346,250.00, it’s no doubt that investors started paying attention to NFTs. Beeple also created history for the fact that this sale marked the first time an established auction house sold crypto art and accepted cryptocurrency as payment.\nThe second big name is 3LAU. Justin David Blau is a 30-year-old DJ and electronic music producer. He is a pioneer in the music specific NFT space, as he was one of the first musicians to launch a studio album in NFT form. 3LAU also gained recognition when he sold 33 NFTs for various prices, marking the three-year anniversary of his Ultraviolet album. 3LAU netted a collective 11.7 million dollars from the 33 token sales and set the record for the largest NFT sale in an initial offering. The only person to beat him out is now Beeple, who sold a piece of art for $6.6 million on March 11th, 2021.\nPeople like Beeple and 3LAU are making huge names for themselves in the crypto world and are opening doors for artists and musicians into this wild revenue generating frontier. Both these gentlemen have been huge advocates for blockchain/crypto technology as they benefit the freelance creator. Keep an eye out for these names as the NFT craze begins to get even more mainstream.\n","date":"2021-04-14T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://blog.songcha.in/p/big-names-in-the-nft-space/","title":"Big Names in the NFT Space"},{"content":"When my friend and now business teammate Nicky told me about the idea of an NFT as a way to sell digital art, I told him he was absolutely insane. Me being the archaic iPhone 6 owner that I am, the idea of crypto art was so foreign to me. I voiced my opinion to Nicky that these art tokens would have no demand; after all they are just pictures or GIFs sitting on my computer screen. I was amazed when I started to look at some of the prices that these NFTs were going for. $400,000 for a picture of a Jordan 1? Crazy. Who would buy that?\nI then realized who would buy that. The same person who would buy a physical, deadstock Jordan 1, might buy the digitized version of the shoe as well. The even cooler thing about the digital Jordan 1 is that it is one-of-a-kind. It has an authentication code attached that makes it unique to any other digital art piece on the market. This owner can now show the art off to his/her friends, and proudly say that he/she is the sole owner of the piece.\nYou might be asking, who the hell would buy an NFT to show off? You can’t even touch it! Some might agree with you, but as our world becomes more digitally socialized, more functions of our lives are beginning their rapid ascent to the cloud. People are finding dates online, sharing memories online, selling stocks online, you name it. Why not buy and sell unique art and music online?\n","date":"2021-04-14T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://blog.songcha.in/p/explaining-demand-for-nfts-a-personal-anecdote/","title":"Explaining demand for NFTs, a personal anecdote"},{"content":"We are excited to announce that SongChain has advanced to the Investment Round of the Dempsey Startup Competition at the University of Washington!

A better way to explain this is to talk about what the word fungible means. Bitcoin is fungible. Just like a US dollar, one Bitcoin is worth the same as another single Bitcoin. Bitcoin can also be easily interchanged with another currency such as the US dollar via a normal exchange rate. At the time of me writing this, 1 Bitcoin is worth $63,135.\nSo, what does non-fungible mean? Non-fungible means that something cannot be traded or exchanged at equivalency. In simpler terms, NFTs cannot be interchanged with anything else, as they are completely unique.\nHere’s an example comparing corn and houses. Fun right. Corn is fungible. A specific commodity like No. 2 Yellow Corn is fungible because it does not matter where that corn was grown, all corn designated as that specific type of corn is worth the exact same amount. Your house on the other hand, is not fungible. Sure, you might have the exact same house right next to yours. It could have been built by the same contractor, have the same interior, same paint, same everything, but the fact that it is in a different spot than yours makes it unique. The location of your house makes it completely different from all other houses in the world, making it non-fungible. There is no identical substitute for your house.\nBack to NFTs An NFT is a unique digital certificate tied to a unique digital asset. Think of it has a unique, one-of-a-kind collector’s item; say the Mona Lisa painting. There is only one Mona Lisa in the world, and someone owns it. When you own an NFT, you are the only owner of that token in the entire world.\nNow let’s talk about valuing these suckers. Your NFT and the Mona Lisa are the same in principle, but why is your NFT not worth as much as the Mona Lisa?\nThe value of your NFT vs the Mona Lisa has to do with demand and scarcity. Your NFT is scarce, yes, there is only one of it. Where your NFT falls short is on the demand side. The Mona Lisa is worth so much because so many people in the world want that unique item. It holds sentimental value, historic value, and creative value to Billions of people. An NFT is like the Mona Lisa, but in digital form. No, you cannot touch it, but you can show it off and look at it like you would the Mona Lisa painting.\n","date":"2021-04-14T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://blog.songcha.in/p/wtf-is-an-nft/","title":"WTF is an NFT?"}]
