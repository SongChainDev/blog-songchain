[{"content":"When my friend and now business teammate Nicky told me about the idea of an NFT as a way to sell digital art, I told him he was absolutely insane. Me being the archaic iPhone 6 owner that I am, the idea of crypto art was so foreign to me. I voiced my opinion to Nicky that these art tokens would have no demand; after all they are just pictures or GIFs sitting on my computer screen. I was amazed when I started to look at some of the prices that these NFTs were going for. $400,000 for a picture of a Jordan 1? Crazy. Who would buy that?\nI then realized who would buy that. The same person who would buy a physical, deadstock Jordan 1, might buy the digitized version of the shoe as well. The even cooler thing about the digital Jordan 1 is that it is one-of-a-kind. It has an authentication code attached that makes it unique to any other digital art piece on the market. This owner can now show the art off to his/her friends, and proudly say that he/she is the sole owner of the piece.\nYou might be asking, who the hell would buy an NFT to show off? You can’t even touch it! Some might agree with you, but as our world becomes more digitally socialized, more functions of our lives are beginning their rapid ascent to the cloud. People are finding dates online, sharing memories online, selling stocks online, you name it. Why not buy and sell unique art and music online?\n","date":"2021-04-14T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://blog.songcha.in/p/explaining-demand-for-nfts-a-personal-anecdote/","title":"Explaining demand for NFTs, a personal anecdote"},{"content":"We are excited to announce that SongChain has advanced to the Investment Round of the Dempsey Startup Competition at the University of Washington!

A better way to explain this is to talk about what the word fungible means. Bitcoin is fungible. Just like a US dollar, one Bitcoin is worth the same as another single Bitcoin. Bitcoin can also be easily interchanged with another currency such as the US dollar via a normal exchange rate. At the time of me writing this, 1 Bitcoin is worth $63,135.\nSo, what does non-fungible mean? Non-fungible means that something cannot be traded or exchanged at equivalency. In simpler terms, NFTs cannot be interchanged with anything else, as they are completely unique.\nHere’s an example comparing corn and houses. Fun right. Corn is fungible. A specific commodity like No. 2 Yellow Corn is fungible because it does not matter where that corn was grown, all corn designated as that specific type of corn is worth the exact same amount. Your house on the other hand, is not fungible. Sure, you might have the exact same house right next to yours. It could have been built by the same contractor, have the same interior, same paint, same everything, but the fact that it is in a different spot than yours makes it unique. The location of your house makes it completely different from all other houses in the world, making it non-fungible. There is no identical substitute for your house.\nBack to NFTs An NFT is a unique digital certificate tied to a unique digital asset. Think of it has a unique, one-of-a-kind collector’s item; say the Mona Lisa painting. There is only one Mona Lisa in the world, and someone owns it. When you own an NFT, you are the only owner of that token in the entire world.\nNow let’s talk about valuing these suckers. Your NFT and the Mona Lisa are the same in principle, but why is your NFT not worth as much as the Mona Lisa?\nThe value of your NFT vs the Mona Lisa has to do with demand and scarcity. Your NFT is scarce, yes, there is only one of it. Where your NFT falls short is on the demand side. The Mona Lisa is worth so much because so many people in the world want that unique item. It holds sentimental value, historic value, and creative value to Billions of people. An NFT is like the Mona Lisa, but in digital form. No, you cannot touch it, but you can show it off and look at it like you would the Mona Lisa painting.\n","date":"2021-04-14T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://blog.songcha.in/p/wtf-is-an-nft/","title":"WTF is an NFT?"}]
