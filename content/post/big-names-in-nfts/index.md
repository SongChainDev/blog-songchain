Every asset market has recognizable, household names attached to them. In terms of the equities markets, you may think of Warren Buffet, Benjamin Graham, or even Elon Musk. You think of these people for their popularity, and also their notoriety within the game that is the stock market.
The market for NFTs is still in its infancy, but we are already seeing major players emerge as marker creators and market movers. In this piece, I will outline some key names that you should look out for when utilizing the NFT market.

The first big name is Mike Winkelmann, better known as Beeple. Beeple is on the artist/creator side of the market and has made a name for himself through the creation of unique digital masterpieces. His piece titled “Everydays: The First 5000 Days,” was largely responsible for the mainstream media’s coverage on NFT sales. Seeing as this token sold for $69,346,250.00, it’s no doubt that investors started paying attention to NFTs. Beeple also created history for the fact that this sale marked the first time an established auction house sold crypto art and accepted cryptocurrency as payment.

The second big name is 3LAU. Justin David Blau is a 30-year-old DJ and electronic music producer. He is a pioneer in the music specific NFT space, as he was one of the first musicians to launch a studio album in NFT form. 3LAU also gained recognition when he sold 33 NFTs for various prices, marking the three-year anniversary of his Ultraviolet album. 3LAU netted a collective 11.7 million dollars from the 33 token sales and set the record for the largest NFT sale in an initial offering. The only person to beat him out is now Beeple, who sold a piece of art for $6.6 million on March 11th, 2021.

People like Beeple and 3LAU are making huge names for themselves in the crypto world and are opening doors for artists and musicians into this wild revenue generating frontier. Both these gentlemen have been huge advocates for blockchain/crypto technology as they benefit the freelance creator. Keep an eye out for these names as the NFT craze begins to get even more mainstream.
