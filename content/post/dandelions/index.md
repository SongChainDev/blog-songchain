Named after a local New Englander’s famous dandelion wine, the Dandelions harken jam band sounds from a variety of artists and time periods. Led collectively by Cam Guage ‘22 (saxophone), Connor Morris ‘22 (keys and vocals), Keeks George ‘22 (guitar and vocals), Peter Chabot ‘22 (guitar), TJ Bryan ‘23 (bass), and Nate Koidahl ‘22 (drums), the Dandelions have performed on campus in Greek and school spaces (including the Homecoming Bonfire 2021) and and plan to bring vibes to Cornell this spring.
